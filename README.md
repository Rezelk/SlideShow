SlideShow
=========

This is web presentation tools  that created as prototype with HTML5 and CSS3.

------

## 1. What's this?

This is web presentation tools.
My concept is more simple, do more stylish presentation :)
You edit ASCII file, and you can present slide show.

## 2. How to use

The first, edit slideshow file "myslide.txt" in "content" directory.

Grammer:
 Shileshow file file is based on like Markdown notation and like PukiWiki notation.
 If you want to know details of grammar, you refer sample slideshow text (myslide.txt).

If you want to change file name of slideshow or reference, you have to change "ops.xml".
cf) src(attribute) in slideshow(element)

The second, open "base.html", and click start presentation button.
Wait for magic :)
